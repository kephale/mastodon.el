* mastodon.el updated

This is an updated version of the great but seemingly dormant mastodon client for emacs.

This is now the version available via MELPA.

[The original readme is below.]

It adds the following features:

It also makes some small cosmetic changes to make timelines easier to read, and makes some functions asynchronous, based on https://github.com/ieure/mastodon.el.

The minimum Emacs version is now 27.1. But if you are running an older version it shouldn't be very hard to get it working.

** live-updating timelines: =mastodon-async-mode=

(code taken from https://github.com/alexjgriffith/mastodon-future.el.)

Works for federated, local, and home timelines and for notifications. It's a little touchy, one thing to avoid is trying to load a timeline more than once at a time. It can go off the rails a bit, but it's still pretty cool.

To enable, it, add =(require 'mastodon-async)= to your =init.el=. Then you can view a timeline with one of the commands that begin with =mastodon-async--stream-=.

** translating toots

You can translate toots with =mastodon-toot--translate-toot-text=. At the moment this requires [[https://codeberg.org/martianh/lingva.el][lingva.el]], a little interface I wrote to https://lingva.ml, to be installed to work.

You could easily modify the simple function to use your emacs translator of choice (=google-translate=, =babel=, =go-translate=, etc.), you just need to fetch the toot's content with =(mastodon-tl--content toot)= and pass it to your translator function as its text argument. Here's what =mastodon-toot--translate-toot-text= looks like:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun mastodon-toot--translate-toot-text ()
    "Translate text of toot at point.
    Uses `lingva.el'."
      (interactive)
      (let* ((toot (mastodon-tl--property 'toot-json)))
        (if toot
            (lingva-translate nil (mastodon-tl--content toot))
          (message "No toot to translate?"))))
#+end_src

** NB: dependencies

This version depends on the library =request= (for uploading attachments). You can install it from MELPA, or https://github.com/tkf/emacs-request. It also depends on =seq=.

Optional dependencies:
- =company= for autocompletion of mentions when composing a toot
- =emojify= for inserting and viewing emojis
- =mpv= and =mpv.el= for viewing videos and gifs
- =lingva.el= for translating toots

** NB: bugs

This repo also incorporates fixes for two bugs that were never merged into the upstream repo: 
- https://github.com/jdenen/mastodon.el/issues/227 (and https://github.com/jdenen/mastodon.el/issues/234)
- https://github.com/jdenen/mastodon.el/issues/228

** contributing

Contributions are welcome.

1. Create an here on codeberg detailing the feature you'd like to add.
2. Fork the repository and create a branch off of =develop=.
3. Create a pull request referencing the issue created in step 1.

* Original README

** Installation

Clone this repository and add the lisp directory to your load path.
Then, require it and go.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/mastodon.el/lisp")
    (require 'mastodon)
#+END_SRC

Or, with =use-package=:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package mastodon
    :ensure t)
#+END_SRC

*** MELPA

Add =MELPA= to your archives:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'package)
  (add-to-list 'package-archives
               '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/") t)
#+END_SRC

Update and install:

=M-x package-refresh-contents RET=

=M-x package-install RET mastodon RET=

*** Emoji

=mastodon-mode= will enable [[https://github.com/iqbalansari/emacs-emojify][Emojify]] if it is loaded in your Emacs environment, so
there's no need to write your own hook anymore. =emojify-mode= is not required.

*** Discover

=mastodon-mode= can provide a context menu for its keybindings if [[https://github.com/mickeynp/discover.el][Discover]] is
installed. It is not required.

if you have Discover, add the following to your Emacs init configuration:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'mastodon-discover)
  (with-eval-after-load 'mastodon (mastodon-discover))
#+END_SRC

Or, with =use-package=:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package mastodon
    :ensure t
    :config
    (mastodon-discover))
#+END_SRC

** Usage
*** Instance

You need to set 2 variables in your init file to get started:

1. mastodon-instance-url
2. mastodon-active-user

(see their doc strings for details). For example If you want to post
toots as "example_user@social.instance.org", then put this in your init
file:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (setq mastodon-instance-url "https://social.instance.org"
          mastodon-active-user "example_user")
#+END_SRC

Then *restart* Emacs and run =M-x mastodon=. Make sure you are connected
to internet before you do this. If you have multiple mastodon accounts
you can activate one at a time by changing those two variables and
restarting Emacs.

If you have been using mastodon.el before this change and the above
steps do not work it's advisable that you delete the old file specified
by =mastodon-client--token-file= and restart Emacs and follow the steps
again.

*** Timelines

=M-x mastodon=

Opens a =*mastodon-home*= buffer in the major mode so you can see toots. You will be prompted for email and password. The app registration process will take place if your =mastodon-token-file= does not contain =:client_id= and =:client_secret=.

|--------+-------------------------|

*** Toot toot

=M-x mastodon-toot=

Pops a new buffer/window with a =mastodon-toot= minor mode. Enter the
contents of your toot here. =C-c C-c= sends the toot. =C-c C-k= cancels.
Both actions kill the buffer and window.

If you have not previously authenticated, you will be prompted for your
account email and password. *NOTE*: Email and password are NOT stored by mastodon.el.

Authentication stores your access token in the =mastodon-auth--token=
variable. It is not stored on your filesystem, so you will have to
re-authenticate when you close/reopen Emacs.

**** Customization
The default toot visibility can be changed by setting or customizing the =mastodon-toot--default-visibility= variable. Valid values are ="public"=, ="unlisted"=, ="private"=, or =direct=.

Toot visibility can also be changed on a per-toot basis from the new toot buffer.

**** Keybindings

|-----------+------------------------|
| Key       | Action                 |
|-----------+------------------------|
| =C-c C-c= | Send toot              |
| =C-c C-k= | Cancel toot            |
| =C-c C-w= | Add content warning    |
| =C-c C-v= | Change toot visibility |
